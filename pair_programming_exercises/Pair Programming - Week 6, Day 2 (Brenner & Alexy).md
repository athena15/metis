#### Pair Question

For each question below, say yes, no or somewhat for these classification algorithms: KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Naive Bayes.

    1) Is it interpretable?
    2) Is it inherently multi-class?
    3) Is it scalable with large number of features (in terms of execution time and quality of results during predict)?
    4) Is it scalable with large number of data points (in terms of execution time and quality of results during predict)?
    5) Is normalization/scaling required?
